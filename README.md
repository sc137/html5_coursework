# html5_coursework
homework and exercises for the html5 course on edx

This is a github repository for my practice while taking the [HTML5 course from W3C](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-html5-w3c-w3cx-html5-1x) at EDx.

Also, I'm using [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com) to view these on a live server. [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/?html,output) works well for that too.
